# The Calendar Demo!
This demo was put together using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). I have tried to go above the initial requirements, and have added the ability to add and delete events. I have also made the month display in such a way that it will correctly pull in days from the previous and next months as needed. 

## Getting it Started
1. ```npm i```
1. ```npm run```
1. Open browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000, or click [here](http://localhost:3000/).

## Testing
1. ```npm run test```
